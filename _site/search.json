    "text": "I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, School of Nursing, studying the effect of digital environment and mobile health interventions on sleep and cognitive function for older adults with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nCurrently, I split my time between longitudinal data analysis using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) to understand the impact of the multi-level digital environment on cognitive domains, and wrapping up the Sound Study regarding the effect of 40Hz acoustic modalities and preferred music on older adults with MCI. Due to my personal interest in data visualization, I worked on some side projects, such as an Emergency Room Dashboard, and voluntarily built a program performance dashboard for a non-profit organization that cultivates BIPOC’s young leadership in Baltimore.\nBy training, I am either a public health or nurse scientist; professionally, I’ve worked as a registered nurse in a geriatric ward and as a mixed-method specialist for a Washington State Department of Health project.\nOn this site I keep a list of my projects, publications, and presentations, as well as a learning blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndemo citation."
