## Bio

I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing pursuing dual research interests: memory care in long-term care settings and technology use among community-dwelling older adults.

My current research focuses on analyzing the [National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS)](https://www.nhats.org/researcher/nhats) longitudinal data to examine how various technology activities impact cognitive domains. I also conduct policy analysis of [Memory Care in Assisted Living](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/pnhLW9C0Dke68U3EIAeIUQ/project-details/11050173) using the method of [health services regulatory analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33426637/), and performing spatial analysis of long-term care market dynamics using ArcGIS as well.

Due to my personal interest in data visualization, I worked on some side projects, such as an [Emergency Room Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/ER_dashboard_story/ERDashboardStory?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link), and voluntarily built a program performance dashboard for a non-profit organization that cultivates BIPOC's young leadership in Baltimore.

By training, I am either a public health or nurse scientist; professionally, I've worked as a registered nurse in a geriatric ward and as a mixed-method specialist for a [Washington State Department of Health project](https://app.leg.wa.gov/ReportsToTheLegislature/Home/GetPDF?fileName=ECS%20Report%20(Chapter%2058%20Laws%20of%202022)_8c782540-b0f4-48b7-813d-fe1155f84d2a.pdf).

On this site I keep a list of [my projects](projects), [publications](papers), and [presentations](presentations), as well as a [learning blog](blog.html).
